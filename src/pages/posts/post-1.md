# My First Blog Post

Published On : 2022-07-01

Welcome to My _new Blog_ About Learning Astro! I Will Share My Learning Journey as I Build my New Website

## What I Have Accompplished

1. **Installing Astro** : First I Created a New Astro Project and setup My Online Accounts.

2. **Making Pages** : I then Learned How to Make Pages By Creating new `.astro` files and Placing them in `src/pages` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts** : This is My First Blog Post! I now have Astro Pages and Markdown Posts!

# Whats new
